# Typiller-Typewriters

Fictional Typewriter E-commerce Site
This project is a fictional e-commerce site designed to enhance HTML, CSS, and JS skills. It simulates the sale of typewriters and incorporates various features and functionalities. The project consists of the following sections:


All HTML part was developed by my own. JS and CSS were developed under eventual consulting.
I) "Models" section, represented by **index.html** show us two typewriters models: Typiller Classic and Typiller Glamour;

II) "Typography" section from "**typography.html"**, which is linked to **"script-tp.js"** has two funcionalities:
- A JS program that, while the user is typing something, it is displayed in three different typographies that are available in Typiller: Default, Poppins and Italic;
- A randomic quote displayed in those typographies that can be refreshed. The quotes come from "**sayings.json"**;

III) "Trend" section represented by **"view.html"** telling some history about typewriters;

IV) "Buy" section, linked to **"script-payment.js"** containing a slideshow that changes the image each 3 seconds, but also can change to previous or next image when this respective buttons are clicked.
Buy includes a box that you can select how many Classic and Glamour you want. If at least one typewriter is selected, it displays the price and shows a link for the payment section;

V) "Payment" section, as **"payment.html"** and linked to **"script-payment.js"**, containing fields that must be fulled with costumer data. When button "Generate Order" is clicked, 
it will generate a .txt file just like a receipt, containing cleaning and formated data costumer. Important: it will not generate a receipt if one of the required fileds are empty. If phone digits or document digits are less or more that it should be, an alert will be displayed and it will not generate receipt.
